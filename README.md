# Details
The program interacts with a google table as a data source. The program has no control over the user's answers and the user personally evaluates his skills. If a person does not know a word, it is put at the end of the queue and will be repeated to reinforce the material.The data is taken from a personal dictionary, which allows you to learn really important material.
